- **Secure**: All sensitive data is handled securely through Tauri's IPC bridge

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- **UI Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Component Library**: Custom shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React hooks with async Tauri command invocation
- **Icons**: Lucide React for consistent iconography
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom gradient themes

### Backend (Tauri + Rust)
- **Framework**: Tauri v2 for secure desktop application development
- **IBKR Integration**: Using `ibapi` Rust crate for TWS/Gateway communication
- **Async Runtime**: Tokio for handling concurrent operations
- **Error Handling**: Custom error types with thiserror
- **Logging**: Structured logging with tracing

## 🔧 Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **Rust** (latest stable)
- **pnpm** (recommended) or npm
- **Interactive Brokers TWS** or **IB Gateway** running locally
- IBKR account with API access enabled

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quantum-kapital.git
cd quantum-kapital
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Configure IBKR connection:
   - Ensure TWS or IB Gateway is running
   - Default connection settings: `127.0.0.1:4002`
   - Client ID: 100 (configurable in the app)

## 🚀 Development

Run the application in development mode:

```bash
pnpm tauri dev
```

This will:
- Start the Vite dev server for the React frontend
- Build and run the Tauri application
- Enable hot module replacement for the frontend
- Watch for changes in the Rust code

## 📱 Building for Production

Create a production build:

```bash
pnpm tauri build
```

This will create optimized binaries for your platform in `src-tauri/target/release/`.

## 🔌 IBKR API Configuration

### TWS Configuration
1. Enable API connections in TWS:
   - File → Global Configuration → API → Settings
   - Enable "Enable ActiveX and Socket Clients"
   - Configure "Socket port" (default: 4002)
   - Add "127.0.0.1" to "Trusted IPs"

### IB Gateway Configuration
1. Similar settings available in IB Gateway
2. Recommended for production use (more stable for long-running connections)

## 📊 Available Commands

The application exposes the following Tauri commands:

- `ibkr_connect`: Establish connection to IBKR
- `ibkr_disconnect`: Close the connection
- `ibkr_get_connection_status`: Check connection status
- `ibkr_get_accounts`: Retrieve account list
- `ibkr_get_account_summary`: Get detailed account metrics
- `ibkr_get_positions`: Fetch current positions
- `ibkr_subscribe_market_data`: Subscribe to real-time quotes
- `ibkr_place_order`: Submit orders to IBKR

## 🎨 UI Components

The application uses a comprehensive component library:

- **Cards**: Display account metrics and positions
- **Tabs**: Navigate between positions and account details
- **Buttons**: Connect/disconnect and action buttons
- **Input fields**: Configure connection settings
- **Badges**: Status indicators
- **Tables**: Position listings (extensible)

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- All IBKR API communications happen through the Rust backend
- No sensitive data is exposed to the web context
- Connection settings are managed securely through Tauri's state management
- Consider using environment variables for production deployments
